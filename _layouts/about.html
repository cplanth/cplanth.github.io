<br> Here's my store : prices are in USD and include shipping. More pottery photos are posted on my instagram account @czpceramics. I welcome comissions, and especially love making specific planters for specific plants. Please <a href="mailto:cadencecadence@gmail.com">contact me</a> to discuss.

<br>Hi! My name is Cadence Planthara
<br>Welcome to my website. I am an artist and craftsperson currently living in so-called Toronto, Canada. My people come from all over (but, as far as I know, not here) and have had Canadian citizenship for 1-3 generations. 
<br>
<br>I make functional objects. My primary curiosity is centred around coming into better relationship with others (this in a very expanded sense), and the connection between play and transformation. I love working with children and plants. 
<br>
<br>I have been studying astrology since ---, giving prepared natal consultations since --,and am currently available to read for you (more info on that here). 
<br>
<br>For information about upcoming and past exhibitions, see the News section. For a list of books I'm currently thinking about, click here. 
 best to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults">follow the documentation's instructions for creating my own Gem-based theme?</a> or is this scrappy style equally ok?
