<br> Here's my store : prices are in USD and include shipping. More pottery photos are posted on my instagram account @czpceramics. I welcome comissions, and especially love making specific planters for specific plants. Please <a href="mailto:cadencecadence@gmail.com">contact me</a> to discuss.

<p><u><b>QUESTIONS</b></u>
<br>In larger windows, I'd like to keep the text inside a narrower box, no border, justified to the left: how? 
<br>with CSS viewport? 
<br>
<br><i>I guess it's time to figure out what Sass is..</i>
<br>
<br>ok haha it looks like I totally got rid of(?) or never installed(?) a premade Jekyll theme, and have been fumbling through inventing my own. 
<br>Would it be best to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults">follow the documentation's instructions for creating my own Gem-based theme?</a> or is this scrappy style equally ok?
