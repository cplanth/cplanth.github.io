<p><b>QUESTIONS:</b>
  <br>
<br>my external HD isn't working any more.... why ? any ideas any ideas
<br>
<br>is there any reason I'd want to add a CMS to this website? apparently Becca Abe did that, using Netlify. would that make it easier to post from phone? do I care?
<br>..for misc_img maybe, if I'm really doing this.
<br>what about... an RSS feed? haha
<br>
<br>it looks like I totally got rid of(?) or never installed(?) a premade Jekyll theme, and have been fumbling through inventing my own. 
<br>Would it be best to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults">follow the documentation's instructions for creating my own Gem-based theme?</a> or is this scrappy style equally ok?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>TO DO:</b>
<ul>
  <li>style my < ul > lol</li>
<br>- figure out moon API 
<br>- and date one -- can I make it so the days of the week link to info about the planets? (internal or external pages....)
<br>- and how to save this properly, using whatever git thing time machine thing. vim
<br>- make the About page show up
<br>- replace these bgcolors w some lighter ones
<br>- seriously think about how the store should look
<br>- read about Sass? idk: want a more elegant responsive look for my little div menu box
<br>
<br>* tell Yulia that she should use my idea if she wants to !

</ul>
