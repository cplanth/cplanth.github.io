<p><u><b>QUESTIONS</b></u>
<br>why don't the above links work?
<br>although.. the way I envision this page, I don't really care if the links work. 
<br>I just want to post photos and have them show up chronologically, starting with the most recent, maybe published with a date, but actually probably no text. Just images. 
<br>would be cool if the last updated thing at the top was automated
